## Project Summary

## Shotgun on that B

This project implements a single-page React application that functions as a user-friendly form for data submission to a Supabase database. It incorporates the following features:

- **Inquiry Limit:** Manages the number of concurrent inquiries to prevent overwhelming the system.
- **Basic Authentication:** Employs Supabase for user login, ensuring data security.
- **Photo Uploads:** Enables users to upload photos and store them within the Supabase database.
- **Non-Technical User Friendly:** Designed with a straightforward interface for users without technical expertise.

## Checklist

**Frontend (React):**

- **Project Setup:**
    - Initialize a new React project using `create-react-app`.
    - Install required dependencies:
        - `react-router-dom` for routing between login and form components.
        - `@supabase/supabase-js` for interacting with the Supabase database.
        - Optionally, a form validation library like `react-hook-form` or `formik` to simplify form validation.
        - If using photo uploads, an image handling library like `react-dropzone` or a state management solution like Redux or Context API to manage uploaded images.

- **Components:**
    - Create separate React components for:
        - Login: Handles user login with Supabase.
        - Form: Renders the form for data entry, including fields for text input and photo upload (if applicable).
        - Success/Error: Displays messages to the user after form submission.

- **Supabase Integration:**
    - Set up a Supabase project and obtain the necessary connection details (URL, public key, etc.).
    - Create a Supabase client instance within your React app using the connection details.

- **Form Handling:**
    - Design the form with input fields for the desired data points.
    - Implement form validation to ensure data integrity before submission.
    - Handle form submission using the Supabase client to send data to the appropriate table in your Supabase database.
    - Optionally, integrate photo upload functionality using the chosen library.
        - Store uploaded photos in Supabase Storage (consider file size limitations).
        - Save the image URL along with other form data in the database.

- **Inquiry Limit (Optional):**
    - Implement logic to track the number of submitted inquiries.
    - Display a message or disable the form if the limit is reached.
    - Consider using a state management solution or a server-side mechanism (e.g., Supabase Functions) for robust inquiry management.

- **Routing:**
    - Set up routing using `react-router-dom` to manage navigation between the login and form components.
    - Protect the form component with authentication logic to ensure only logged-in users can access it.

- **Error Handling:**
    - Implement error handling for Supabase operations (login, data submission, etc.) to provide informative messages to the user in case of issues.

**Backend (Supabase):**

- **Database Setup:**
    - Create a table in your Supabase database to store the form data.
    - Define appropriate data types for each column.
    - Optionally, create a storage bucket in Supabase Storage to store uploaded photos (if applicable).

- **Security Rules (Optional):**
    - If necessary, implement Supabase security rules to control data access and prevent unauthorized modifications.

**Deployment**

- Choose a deployment method that suits your needs (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Supabase Edge Functions).
- Follow the deployment instructions for your chosen platform.

**Testing**

- Thoroughly test all functionalities, including login, form submission, photo uploads (if applicable), and inquiry limit (if implemented).
- Consider using testing libraries like Jest or React Testing Library.

**Additional Considerations**

- **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface for easy data entry.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the form is accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Loading States:** Implement loading indicators for Supabase operations to provide feedback to the user.
- **Responsive Design:** Make the form responsive for optimal viewing across different devices.
- **Localization (Optional):** If targeting a global audience, consider localization support for different languages.

By following this checklist and incorporating the best practices mentioned, you'll create a robust and user-friendly React application that effectively collects data using Supabase.
